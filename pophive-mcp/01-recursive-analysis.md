### B. Convergence (5 Whys)

**Element: Input data (Past - Self)**

*   **Why do we need to use existing public health datasets?** To provide a foundation of credible and widely accepted health information.
*   **Why is this foundation important?** Because it allows users to trust the data and the insights derived from it.
*   **Why is trust in the data so crucial?** Because public health decisions and interventions have real-world consequences for people's lives.
*   **Why do these decisions have such high stakes?** Because they can affect the health and well-being of entire populations.
*   **Root Cause:** The ultimate goal is to improve population health outcomes, which requires a foundation of trustworthy data to inform high-stakes decisions.

**Element: Input control (Present - Others)**

*   **Why do users need to choose which tools to use?** Because different tools are designed for different analytical tasks.
*   **Why are there different tools for different tasks?** To provide a flexible and powerful platform that can support a wide range of use cases.
*   **Why is flexibility and power important?** Because public health challenges are complex and multifaceted, requiring a variety of analytical approaches.
*   **Why are public health challenges so complex?** Because they involve the interplay of biological, social, economic, and environmental factors.
*   **Root Cause:** The complexity of public health challenges requires a versatile toolkit that empowers users to explore data from multiple angles and apply the most appropriate analytical methods.
